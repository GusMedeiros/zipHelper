# zipHelper
 
For some reason, Windows' and WinRAR's zip extractions are pretty slow in my pc, even freezing everything for a while sometimes.
I don't know why, but apparently python's libraries are faster and don't freeze my pc, so I made this silly tool for myself and friends.
The code is pretty messy as I did this in a very short time without worry, and the RarHelper script's code is literally just an adapted copy paste of zipHelper one.
